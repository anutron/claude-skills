# Spec Writer

Pure spec text production. Takes approved intent and a target, writes properly formatted spec text. No judgment, no inference, no questions asked. Think of this as a formatter — you tell it what to write, it writes it in the right format and the right place.

**This skill is the single source of truth for the SPEC format.** All spec writing should go through this skill for consistency.

## Arguments

- `$ARGUMENTS` - Natural language description of what to write and where

Examples:
```
/spec-writer "Create a new spec for user authentication at specs/auth.md"
/spec-writer "Add rate limiting section to specs/auth.md"
/spec-writer "Insert error handling behavior after §Interface in specs/api.md"
```

Or invoked programmatically by `/spec-recommender` or `/ralph-review` with structured intent.

## Context

- Spec-aware project: !`test -f .specs && cat .specs || echo "no .specs file"`
- Spec directory contents: !`ls specs/*.md 2>/dev/null | head -10`

## The SPEC Format

When creating a new spec file, use this template:

```markdown
# SPEC: {Feature Name}

## Purpose
Why this exists, what problem it solves.

## Interface
- **Inputs**: What goes in
- **Outputs**: What comes out
- **Dependencies**: What it needs

## Behavior
Step-by-step: given X, system does Y, resulting in Z.
Describe each distinct behavior as its own subsection or numbered item.

## Test Cases
- Happy path scenarios
- Error cases and how they're handled
- Edge cases and boundary conditions

## Examples
Concrete usage examples with real data.
```

**When appending to an existing spec, do NOT force this template.** Read the existing file first and match its style and structure. If the spec organizes by tool (like a tool-by-tool description), follow that. If it uses different heading levels, match those. The template is for new files only.

---

## Instructions

```
1. Parse the intent from $ARGUMENTS or programmatic input

2. Determine the target:
   IF a file path is mentioned → use it
   IF intent says "create" or "new" → create a new file
     Default location: specs/ directory (from .specs file, or specs/ if no .specs)
   IF intent says "append" or "add to" → append to existing file
   IF intent says "insert after <section>" → insert after that section
   IF ambiguous → default to append if file exists, create if it doesn't

3. IF target file exists:
   - Read it fully
   - Analyze its structure (heading levels, section patterns, style)
   - You MUST match that style — do not impose the template on existing files

4. IF creating a new file:
   - Use the full SPEC template above
   - Fill in every section from the provided intent
   - Leave no section empty — if the intent doesn't cover a section,
     write a reasonable placeholder based on the intent
     (e.g., "## Test Cases\n- Verify {primary behavior} works as described")

5. IF appending:
   - Add a new section at the end of the file
   - Match the existing heading level and formatting style
   - Add a blank line before the new section

6. IF inserting after a named section:
   - Find the section heading
   - Insert new content after that section's content (before the next heading)
   - Match the existing formatting

7. Write the text to the file using the Write or Edit tool

8. Print what was written and where:
   "Spec text written to {file path}. {N} lines added. Not committed."

9. Do NOT commit — the caller handles that
```

## What This Skill Does NOT Do

- **No inference** — It does not figure out what the intent should be. The caller (user, spec-recommender, or ralph-review) provides the intent.
- **No contradiction detection** — It does not check if the new text contradicts existing spec text. Ralph-review's review sub-agent catches those.
- **No clarifying questions** — If the intent is unclear, the caller should have resolved that before invoking this skill.
- **No committing** — The caller decides when and how to commit.
