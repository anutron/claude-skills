# Ralph Review

Autonomous self-review loop that runs after implementation. Reviews the full diff in a fresh context, classifies findings by confidence, auto-fixes what it can, commits, and repeats — until only questions for the user remain. Companion to `/ralph-loop` (which develops changes); this loop reviews them.

## Arguments

- `$ARGUMENTS` - Optional: spec/plan path, SHA, branch name, commit range, or natural language description of what to review

Invocation forms:
```
/ralph-review                          → auto-detect scope
/ralph-review specs/auth.md            → explicit spec, auto-detect diff
/ralph-review abc123                   → diff against specific SHA
/ralph-review "changes from this week" → natural language, agent interprets
```

User-provided arguments always win over auto-detection. If auto-detection is ambiguous, confirm with the user before proceeding.

## Context

- Current branch: !`git branch --show-current`
- Default branch ref: !`git rev-parse --abbrev-ref origin/HEAD 2>/dev/null | grep -v '^origin/HEAD$' | head -1`
- Git status: !`git status --short`
- Spec-aware project: !`test -f .specs && cat .specs || echo "no .specs file"`
- Project type: !`find . -maxdepth 1 \( -name go.mod -o -name Gemfile -o -name package.json -o -name Cargo.toml -o -name pyproject.toml \) 2>/dev/null | head -5`
- Test framework: !`find . -maxdepth 4 -name "*_test.*" -o -name "*.test.*" -o -name "*_spec.*" 2>/dev/null | head -10`
- Recent spec changes: !`git diff --name-only HEAD~10..HEAD -- specs/ 2>/dev/null | head -10`
- Plan files: !`ls -t specs/plans/*.md 2>/dev/null | head -5`

---

## Phase 0: Resolve Scope

Before starting the review loop, resolve two things: what code to review (diff scope) and what to review it against (source of truth).

### Phase 0a: Resolve Diff Scope

Determine the set of changes to review:

```
IF $ARGUMENTS contains a SHA, branch name, or commit range:
  Use that as the diff scope
  BASE = the provided reference
  Commands: git diff {BASE}...HEAD

ELSE IF there are unstaged or staged changes (from git status context):
  Diff scope = working tree changes
  BASE = HEAD
  Commands:
    git diff              (unstaged)
    git diff --cached     (staged)

ELSE IF current branch != default branch (main/master):
  Diff scope = branch changes vs default branch
  BASE = default branch
  Commands: git diff {default}...HEAD

ELSE (on main/master, nothing unstaged):
  Diff scope = local vs origin
  BASE = origin/{default}
  Commands: git diff HEAD...origin/{default}
```

If no changes are found in any of these, tell the user "Nothing to review" and stop.

### Phase 0b: Resolve Source of Truth

Determine what spec/plan to review against. **User-provided paths always win.**

```
IF $ARGUMENTS contains a path to a .md file:
  Use it directly as the source of truth (spec or plan, based on location)
  No confirmation needed

ELSE IF .specs file exists (spec-aware project):
  1. Find relevant specs from the diff:
     git diff --name-only {BASE}...HEAD -- specs/
  2. Also check recently modified specs:
     ls -t specs/*.md | head -5
  3. Use the most relevant spec as PRIMARY source of truth
  4. Read the FULL spec — not just the diff. The spec describes the whole system.
  5. Search for a plan (structural supplement):
     - specs/plans/ (project convention)
     - ~/.claude/plans/
     - ~/.claude/projects/*/plans/
  6. If plan found, note it as advisory context
  7. Auto-proceed — no user confirmation needed

ELSE IF no .specs file, but plan found:
  Search for plans in:
    - specs/plans/
    - Files changed in the diff
    - ~/.claude/plans/
    - ~/.claude/projects/*/plans/
  Use AskUserQuestion: "No specs found. Found plan: {path}. Use as source of truth?"
  If user confirms → proceed with plan
  If user declines → conservative mode

ELSE (neither found):
  Print: "No spec or plan found. Running in conservative mode (auto-fix only obvious bugs, security, lint)."
  Use AskUserQuestion to offer: "Provide a spec/plan path, or continue in conservative mode?"
```

### Confidence Tier

Based on what was found, set the confidence tier for the entire review:

```
IF spec found       → tier = "spec"         (behavioral + structural + bugs/security/lint)
ELSE IF plan found  → tier = "plan"         (structural + bugs/security/lint)
ELSE                → tier = "conservative" (bugs/security/lint only)
```

### Pre-Loop Setup

Record the starting point so ralph's own changes can be isolated later:

```bash
PRE_RALPH_SHA=$(git rev-parse HEAD)
```

Ensure the reviews directory exists and is gitignored:

```bash
mkdir -p .claude/reviews
# Add to .gitignore if not already covered
if ! git check-ignore -q .claude/reviews 2>/dev/null; then
  echo ".claude/reviews/" >> .gitignore
fi
```

Print a status summary:

```
Ralph-review starting:
- Diff scope: {description of what's being reviewed}
- Source of truth: {spec path | plan path | "conservative mode"}
- Confidence tier: {spec | plan | conservative}
- Pre-ralph SHA: {sha}
```

## Phase 1: Review Loop

### Overview

The main thread orchestrates a loop of up to 3 iterations. Each iteration:
1. Spawns a fresh review sub-agent (clean context)
2. Receives structured findings
3. Triages findings (auto-fix / park / skip)
4. Executes auto-fixes
5. Runs tests
6. Commits
7. Checks termination conditions

### Gathering Review Data

Before the first loop iteration, collect everything the reviewer needs:

1. **Full diff:**
   ```bash
   git diff {BASE}...HEAD
   ```

2. **Changed files list:**
   ```bash
   git diff {BASE}...HEAD --name-only
   ```

3. **Read every changed file in its entirety.** The reviewer needs full context, not just diff hunks.

4. **Find dependent files** — files that import, require, or reference changed files. Use Grep to locate them. Read those too.

5. **Spec contents** (if available): Read the full spec file. Not just the section that changed — the entire spec. The reviewer needs the whole system's behavioral contract.

6. **Plan contents** (if available): Read the plan file.

7. **Test baseline:**
   - Detect the test framework from project type
   - Run the full test suite and record: PASS, FAIL (with details), or N/A
   - Run the linter if available and record: CLEAN, WARNINGS, or ERRORS

### Review Sub-Agent Briefing Template

Spawn a single review sub-agent using the `Agent` tool with `subagent_type="general-purpose"`. Do NOT use the 3-independent-reviewer pattern from `/rereview` — one thorough reviewer per loop is sufficient (3 reviewers × 3 loops = 9 agents is excessive).

Use the following prompt template:

````
You are a thorough code reviewer performing an autonomous review for the ralph-review loop.

MANDATE: Analyze every changed line. Classify every finding. When in doubt, flag it.

SUPPRESSION: Lines annotated with `// expected:` (or `# expected:` in Python/shell/YAML) have been reviewed and acknowledged by the user. Do not re-report findings on these lines unless the surrounding logic has materially changed since the comment was added. The comment text explains why the behavior is intentional — read it before deciding.

CONFIDENCE TIER: {confidence_tier}
- "spec": Spec is authoritative for behavior. Plan is advisory for structure.
- "plan": Plan is the best available context. No spec-based behavioral checks.
- "conservative": No spec or plan. Only flag obvious bugs, security issues, and lint.

DIFF SCOPE: {diff_scope_description}
BASE: {base_ref}

SPEC CONTENTS:
{spec_contents or "No spec available."}

PLAN CONTENTS:
{plan_contents or "No plan available."}

FULL DIFF:
{full git diff}

CHANGED FILES (full contents):
{for each changed file, include filename and full contents}

DEPENDENT FILES (files that reference changed code):
{for each dependent file, include filename and full contents}

TEST BASELINE:
- Test suite result: {PASS / FAIL / N/A}
- Pre-existing failures: {list or "None"}
- Lint result: {CLEAN / WARNINGS / ERRORS}

---

## Your Analyses

Perform ALL of the following. Do not skip any.

### 1. Behavior Audit
For every modified function, method, type, or exported symbol:
- What was the old behavior? What is the new behavior?
- Is this change intentional and justified?
- Could any caller break due to the change?
- Are defaults, return types, error conditions, or side effects altered?

### 2. Spec Compliance (spec tier only)
For every behavioral change:
- Does the spec describe the expected behavior?
- Does the code match the spec?
- Is there new behavior the spec doesn't mention? (→ SPEC-DRIFT)
- Does the code contradict the spec? (→ SPEC-DRIFT)

### 3. Plan Compliance (spec and plan tiers)
For structural decisions:
- Does the file organization match the plan?
- Are components placed where the plan specifies?
- Are patterns followed as the plan describes?

### 4. Regression Risk
For each changed file:
- What depends on this file?
- Could the change break dependent code?
- Are edge cases from the old behavior still handled?
- Were error handling or concurrency patterns changed?

### 5. Security Audit
Check: injection flaws, auth changes, credential exposure, input validation, XSS, insecure deserialization, vulnerable dependencies, error info leaks, missing rate limiting, crypto misuse, path traversal, SSRF.

### 6. Test Coverage Gaps
- Are behavior changes covered by tests?
- What test cases are missing?
- Are error paths and edge cases tested?
- If the spec describes behavior and the code implements it correctly but tests are missing — that's a test gap, not spec drift. Classify as [AUTO-FIX] and write the tests.

### 7. Line-by-Line Diff Review
For each hunk:
- Is removed code safe to remove?
- Is added code correct? Trace the logic.
- Off-by-one errors, nil/null risks, type mismatches?
- Boundary conditions handled?

---

## Classification

**Tag EVERY finding with exactly one of these:**

**[AUTO-FIX]** — You are confident this should be fixed, AND one of:
- Spec explicitly states the expected behavior and code doesn't match
- Test exists that should pass but doesn't (and the fix is clear)
- **Spec describes behavior, code implements it correctly, but tests are missing** — write the tests (this is a coverage gap, not drift)
- Obvious bug: nil pointer, off-by-one, unclosed resource, type mismatch
- Security issue: injection, credential exposure, missing auth check
- Lint violation with unambiguous fix
- Plan explicitly specifies structure and code deviates

For each [AUTO-FIX], include:
- File and line number
- What's wrong
- What the fix should be (specific enough to implement)
- Why you're confident (cite spec section, test, or bug category)

**[QUESTION]** — Needs user judgment:
- Spec is silent on this behavior
- Spec and code contradict but unclear which is stale
- Multiple valid fixes exist
- Design concern not addressed by spec or plan
- Behavioral change that looks intentional but has no spec coverage

For each [QUESTION], include:
- File and line number (for the main thread's reference)
- **What's happening** — plain language summary accessible to someone who didn't write the code. Lead with the situation, not the implementation detail.
- **What could go wrong** — the consequence in terms of system behavior, not code mechanics. "Session data could get corrupted" not "the backing array could be shared."
- **Inferred intent** — what you think the developer was trying to achieve and why
- **Recommendation** — what you think should be done and why. Take a position.
- **Options** — put the recommendation first, then alternatives

Frame questions for a user who may not know the codebase. The code was likely written by Claude, not the user. Explain the *so what*, not the *how*.

**[SPEC-DRIFT]** — Behavioral code without spec coverage (spec tier only):
- New behavior with no spec mention
- Changed behavior that contradicts spec
- Code implemented without spec updates

For each [SPEC-DRIFT], include:
- File and line number
- What the code does
- What the spec says (or "spec is silent on this")
- Draft recommendation for what the spec should say

**[ACKNOWLEDGED]** — Suppressed by `// expected:` comment:
- The line has an `// expected:` (or `# expected:`) annotation
- The annotation's reasoning still holds given the current surrounding code
- Do NOT re-report these. List them in a separate "Acknowledged" section for transparency only.
- If the surrounding logic has materially changed and the annotation may be stale, reclassify as `[QUESTION]` with a note that the `// expected:` comment should be reviewed.

**[SKIP]** — Not actionable:
- Stylistic preference with no spec/plan opinion
- "Could be improved" without correctness impact

---

## Output Format

Structure your report as:

### Findings

{Numbered list, each tagged with classification}

1. **[AUTO-FIX]** `file.go:42` — Description. Fix: {specific fix}. Confidence: {spec §X / test / obvious bug}.
2. **[QUESTION]** `handler.go:15` — Description. Needs: {what judgment}.
3. **[SPEC-DRIFT]** `auth.go:88` — New rate limiting behavior. Spec is silent. Recommend: "Add to spec §4: ..."
4. **[SKIP]** `utils.go:20` — Could use a more descriptive variable name.

### Summary
- AUTO-FIX count: {N}
- QUESTION count: {N}
- SPEC-DRIFT count: {N}
- ACKNOWLEDGED count: {N}
- SKIP count: {N}
- Regression confidence: HIGH / MEDIUM / LOW

Do NOT rush. Analyze every changed line. False positives are acceptable; false negatives are not.
````

### Phase 1b: Triage Findings

After the sub-agent returns its report, the main thread triages each finding. **The main thread is the safety check** — it validates that auto-fix classifications are actually supported by the spec/plan.

1. Parse findings by classification tag
2. For each `[AUTO-FIX]`: verify the spec/plan actually supports this fix. If you disagree with the classification, reclassify as `[QUESTION]`.
3. For each `[SPEC-DRIFT]`: collect into a separate drift list
4. For each `[QUESTION]`: collect into the parked list
5. For each `[SKIP]`: collect into the skipped list

**Confidence tier governs what qualifies as auto-fixable:**

| Finding | With Spec | Plan Only | Neither |
|---------|-----------|-----------|---------|
| Behavior doesn't match spec | AUTO-FIX | n/a | n/a |
| Missing error handling | AUTO-FIX (if spec covers errors) | QUESTION | QUESTION |
| Wrong file structure | AUTO-FIX (if plan specifies) | AUTO-FIX (if plan specifies) | SKIP |
| Nil pointer dereference | AUTO-FIX | AUTO-FIX | AUTO-FIX |
| "Should use different pattern" | QUESTION | QUESTION | SKIP |

**Principle:** Less documented intent → less auto-fix, more park.

### Phase 1c: Execute Auto-Fixes

For each `[AUTO-FIX]` finding:

1. Implement the fix as described in the finding
2. After ALL fixes for this iteration are applied, run the test suite
3. **If tests pass:**
   - Commit with message: `ralph-review loop {N}: {summary of fixes}`
   - Record which findings were fixed
4. **If tests fail:**
   - Check test output to identify which fix likely broke things
   - Revert: `git reset --soft HEAD` (undo the staging, keep changes)
   - Then `git checkout -- .` to discard the changes
   - Reclassify the offending fix as `[QUESTION]` with note: "Auto-fix broke tests: {failure details}"
   - Re-apply remaining fixes (if any), re-test, re-commit
5. **If zero auto-fixes this iteration:** exit the loop (clean termination)

### Phase 1d: Loop Control

```
iteration = 0
max_iterations = 3
all_fixed = []       # accumulated across all loops
all_parked = []      # [QUESTION] findings
all_skipped = []     # [SKIP] findings
all_drift = []       # [SPEC-DRIFT] findings

WHILE iteration < max_iterations:
  iteration += 1
  Print: "Ralph-review loop {iteration} of {max_iterations}..."

  1. Spawn fresh review sub-agent with full diff → receives findings
  2. Triage findings (Phase 1b)
  3. IF no [AUTO-FIX] findings this iteration:
       Print: "No auto-fixable issues found. Exiting loop."
       BREAK
  4. Execute auto-fixes (Phase 1c) → commit
  5. Append fixed items to all_fixed
  6. Merge new [QUESTION] into all_parked (deduplicate)
  7. Merge new [SKIP] into all_skipped (deduplicate)
  8. Merge new [SPEC-DRIFT] into all_drift (deduplicate)

IF iteration == max_iterations AND auto_fixes were made in last loop:
  Note: "Max iterations reached — may need another pass"
```

---

## Spec Drift Handling

**Only active when confidence tier is "spec"** (project has `.specs` file). When tier is "plan" or "conservative," skip this section entirely — findings that would be spec drift just go into the `[QUESTION]` bucket.

### What Counts as Spec Drift

- New behavior in code with no spec mention
- Changed behavior that contradicts the spec
- Code implemented without corresponding spec updates

**NOT drift:** Spec describes behavior, code implements it correctly, but tests are missing. That's a test coverage gap — the sub-agent should classify it as `[AUTO-FIX]` and write the tests.

### During the Loop

`[SPEC-DRIFT]` findings are collected separately from `[QUESTION]` findings. They do NOT block the loop — they accumulate across iterations. Each drift item records:

- File and line(s) where unspecified behavior exists
- What the code does
- What the spec says (or "spec is silent on this")
- A draft recommendation for what the spec should say

### Post-Report Resolution

When the user chooses to address spec drift (see Phase 3):

Present each drift item one at a time via `AskUserQuestion`. For each item, show the draft recommendation and ask the user to approve, edit, or reject.

After the user responds to each item:

1. **Update the spec inline** — spec text changes are fast (just writing markdown), so do them in the main thread. Use `/spec-recommender` → `/spec-writer` if available, otherwise write directly.
2. **If code changes are needed** to match the updated spec, dispatch via `/fixit` in background.
3. **Move to the next drift item immediately** — don't wait for the fixit to complete.

Apply the same conflict avoidance rule as questions: if two fixits would touch the same files, serialize them.

After all drift items are addressed and any in-flight fixits complete, offer: "Specs updated. Restart ralph-review to validate against updated specs? (y/n)"

---

## Phase 2: Final Report

After the loop exits, generate the report.

### Setup

```bash
mkdir -p .claude/reviews/$(date +%Y-%m-%d)
```

Write the report to `.claude/reviews/YYYY-MM-DD/ralph-review-report.md` AND display it in the terminal.

### Report Template

```markdown
# Ralph Review Report

## Summary
- **Loops completed:** {N} of 3 ({clean exit | max iterations reached})
- **Confidence tier:** {Spec | Plan | Conservative}
- **Source of truth:** {spec path | plan path | None}
- **Diff scope:** {description}
- **Pre-ralph SHA:** {PRE_RALPH_SHA} (use `git diff {PRE_RALPH_SHA}...HEAD` to see ralph's changes)

## Auto-Fixed
### Loop 1
1. {description} (source: {spec §X | plan | obvious bug})

### Loop 2
1. {description}

{Or "No auto-fixes were needed — code passed review cleanly."}

## Spec Drift
1. **New behavior:** {description} — spec is silent
   - Recommendation: {draft spec text}
2. **Contradiction:** Spec says {X}, code does {Y}
   - Need user input: which is correct?

{Or "No spec drift detected." or "N/A (no spec in use)"}

## Questions for You
1. {description} — {why the agent couldn't fix it}
2. {description} — {what judgment is needed}

{Or "No questions — all findings were resolved."}

## Skipped
- {N} stylistic suggestions (details in full report file)

## Ralph's Changes
- Commits: {N} ({SHA list})
- Files modified: {N}
- Tests: {passing | failing (details)}
```

---

## Phase 3: Post-Report Interaction

After displaying the report, present review options via `AskUserQuestion`. Only show options that have items.

```
What would you like to review?

1. Spec drift ({N} items)
2. Questions for you ({N} items)
3. Skipped findings ({N} items)
4. Ralph's changes ({N} commits, {N} files)
5. Done — accept as-is
```

### Option 1: Spec Drift

See "Spec Drift Handling → Post-Report Resolution" above.

### Option 2: Questions for You

Present each finding one at a time via `AskUserQuestion`. Frame every question for someone who didn't write the code — the user likely directed Claude to build it, not hand-authored it. Lead with the situation and consequence, not implementation details.

```
Question {N} of {total}: {short descriptive title}

{What's happening — plain language, 2-3 sentences. No jargon, no line numbers
in the narrative. Explain the situation as you would to a product owner.}

{What could go wrong — the consequence in terms of system behavior.
"Users could see stale data" not "the goroutine reads a shared pointer."}

Recommendation: {What Ralph thinks should be done and why. Take a position.}

1. Accept recommendation — {what that means concretely}
2. Ignore — mark as expected with an inline comment so future reviews skip it
3. Add to spec — this behavior is intentional, capture it
4. Defer — park this for a future session
```

After the user answers, dispatch the work in the background and immediately present the next question. The user's attention is the bottleneck — don't make them watch serial implementation.

**Dispatching by answer type:**

- **Fix it** → Use `/fixit` to background the fix in a worktree. Compose the fixit description from the finding + the user's answer. Move to the next question immediately.
- **Ignore** → Offer to add an `// expected:` comment to the relevant line(s) so future reviews don't re-report the same finding. Show the proposed annotation for approval (e.g., `// expected: broadcastMessage ignores handled bool`). If the user approves, add the comment and commit it. If they decline, skip silently. Either way, move to next finding.
- **Add to spec** → Update the spec file inline (this is fast — just text), then `/fixit` the implementation in background if code changes are needed. Move to the next question immediately.
- **Defer** → Create a todo marker in `specs/todo/` (see "Todo Markers" below). Move to the next question immediately.

**Conflict avoidance:** Before dispatching a `/fixit`, check if a previously dispatched fixit from this session touches the same file(s). If so, wait for that fixit to complete before dispatching the new one — concurrent worktrees editing the same files will cause merge conflicts. Independent files can run in parallel.

**After all questions are answered:** Wait for any in-flight fixits to complete and report their results. Then re-present the remaining review options.

### Option 3: Skipped Findings

Show the full list in the terminal. Ask via `AskUserQuestion`:

```
Any findings to promote?

1. Promote specific items (enter numbers)
2. None — keep all skipped
```

Promoted items get reclassified and handled per their new bucket (fix or question).

### Option 4: Ralph's Changes

Use `AskUserQuestion` to ask how to review:

```
How would you like to review ralph's changes?

1. Show diff in terminal
2. Open in Plannotator (annotate the report)
3. Create GitHub PR
```

- **Terminal diff:** `git diff {PRE_RALPH_SHA}...HEAD`
- **Plannotator** (only offer if available — check `which plannotator 2>/dev/null`): `plannotator annotate .claude/reviews/YYYY-MM-DD/ralph-review-report.md`
- **GitHub PR:** `gh pr create` with the ralph-review report as the PR body

### Option 5: Done

Accept everything and exit. Print:

```
Ralph-review complete.
- {N} issues auto-fixed across {N} loops
- {N} questions parked for you
- {N} spec drift items {resolved | pending}
- Report saved to: .claude/reviews/YYYY-MM-DD/ralph-review-report.md
```

### Loop Until Done

After completing any option, re-present the remaining options (minus completed ones) until the user picks Done or all options are exhausted.

---

## Todo Markers

When the user defers a finding (question or spec drift item), create a marker file in `specs/todo/`. These markers are lightweight pointers — they capture enough context to pick up the work in a new session without duplicating the full analysis.

### Format

```bash
mkdir -p specs/todo
```

Filename: `YYYY-MM-DD-slug.md` (sorts chronologically, human-scannable).

```markdown
---
source: .claude/reviews/YYYY-MM-DD/ralph-review-report.md
created: YYYY-MM-DD
skill: ralph-review
severity: low | medium | high
files:
  - path/to/affected/file.go
  - path/to/other/file.go
---

# Short title

1-3 sentence description of what needs to happen and why.

See source report for full analysis.
```

### Rules

- Keep the body short — the source report has the details.
- The `files` list helps the `/spec-todo` skill estimate conflicts and scope.
- The `severity` comes from the finding's classification context (security → high, design question → medium, style → low).
- Commit the marker in the same commit as other ralph-review changes, or standalone if the loop is done.

### Lifecycle

When the work is completed (via `/fixit`, `/spec-todo`, or manual fix), delete the marker file and commit the deletion alongside the fix.

---

## Failure Handling

| Failure | Action |
|---------|--------|
| No changes to review | Tell user and stop |
| Sub-agent fails to spawn | Retry once. If still fails, report error and stop |
| Sub-agent returns empty/malformed report | Note in summary, exit loop, produce report with what we have |
| Test suite fails to run | Note in report as increased risk, continue loop |
| Auto-fix breaks tests | Revert fix, reclassify as [QUESTION], continue |
| All findings are [SKIP] | Clean exit, report "No actionable issues found" |
| Max iterations with ongoing fixes | Flag in report: "May need another pass" |
| No spec AND no plan AND no `.specs` | Conservative mode — auto-fix only bugs/security/lint |
| User cancels mid-loop | Committed fixes stay (already committed). Report what was done so far |

## Graceful Degradation

| Available | Behavior |
|-----------|----------|
| Specs + spec-recommender + spec-writer | Full experience: review, fix, drift resolution, spec production |
| Specs only | Loop works fully. Drift reported, user writes specs manually |
| Plan only | Plan-advisory mode. No spec drift detection |
| Nothing | Conservative mode. Auto-fixes only obvious bugs/security/lint |
| No plannotator | Terminal report + GitHub PR option. No Plannotator annotation |

`/spec-recommender` and `/spec-writer` are available as companion skills. If they are not present in a given project, ralph-review degrades gracefully — spec drift items are reported as plain markdown recommendations instead of going through the interactive intent-resolution flow.
