# Execute Plan

Orchestrate plan execution using the agent-driven-development pattern. The main thread acts as a thin coordinator — parsing the plan into a task dependency graph, dispatching agents in worktrees, and merging results. All implementation, review, and testing happens in agents.

## Arguments

- `$ARGUMENTS` - Required: URL or file path to the plan to execute

If no arguments are provided, find the most recently modified plan in the project's `specs/plans/` directory and respond with only this message (no other actions):

```
Your plan is ready. Run /clear and then:

/execute-plan <path-to-most-recent-plan>
```

This ensures execution starts with a fresh context window. Do not proceed with execution — just print the message and stop.

## Context

- Current branch: !`git branch --show-current`
- Git status: !`git status --short`
- Project root: !`pwd`
- Available plans: !`ls -t specs/plans/ 2>/dev/null | head -10`

---

## Phase 0: Load and Parse

1. **Resolve the plan source:**
   - If `$ARGUMENTS` is a file path, read it directly
   - If `$ARGUMENTS` is a URL, fetch it with WebFetch
   - If `$ARGUMENTS` is a plan name without path, look in `specs/plans/` relative to the project root

2. **Locate the design doc.** Plans should reference a design/brainstorm doc at the top (in a `**Design doc:**` field). If present, read it — this is the design source of truth that agents need alongside the plan. If no reference exists, check the plan's parent directory for `brainstorm.md` as a fallback. If neither is found, proceed without it — the plan may be self-contained.

3. **Parse the plan into stages.** Plans typically have numbered sections, phases, or steps. Extract:
   - **Stages**: Ordered list of discrete work chunks
   - **Dependencies**: Which stages depend on others (explicit "depends on stage N" or implicit from ordering)
   - **Scope**: Files, directories, and repos each stage touches

4. **Build a dependency graph.** For each stage, determine:
   - Which other stages must complete first (blockers)
   - Which stages are independent and can run in parallel
   - Dependency signals: explicit mentions ("after stage 2"), shared file scope, or logical ordering (tests before integration)

---

## Worktree Decision

Before execution begins, ask the user how to run the plan:

> **How do you want to run this plan?**
>
> - **Execute on current branch** (recommended) — stages run here, commits land on this branch as they complete
> - **Execute in a worktree** — creates an isolated branch so you can keep working or run another agent in this session. Only useful if you're running multiple coding workstreams at the same time.

Default to "current branch" if the user doesn't have a preference. If the user chooses worktree mode:

1. Create a worktree at `.claude/worktree/<plan-slug>/` for the overall execution
2. All per-stage worktrees nest inside that (`.claude/worktree/<plan-slug>/<task-slug>/`)
3. After all stages complete and merge to the worktree's branch, present the result for the user to merge back to their original branch (via `/close-worktree` or manual merge)

---

## Phase 1: Create Task Graph

Use native `TaskCreate` with `addBlockedBy` to build the full dependency graph upfront. Every stage becomes a task. Independent stages share no blockers and become eligible simultaneously.

```
TaskCreate("Stage 1: Update specs", ...)
TaskCreate("Stage 2: Write failing tests", ..., addBlockedBy: [stage-1-id])
TaskCreate("Stage 3: Implement auth module", ..., addBlockedBy: [stage-2-id])
TaskCreate("Stage 4: Implement API routes", ..., addBlockedBy: [stage-2-id])  <- parallel with stage 3
TaskCreate("Stage 5: Integration tests", ..., addBlockedBy: [stage-3-id, stage-4-id])
```

Present a brief execution summary:

```
## Execution Plan

Loaded: {plan name/path}
Design doc: {path from plan header, or "none"}
Stages: {N}

1. {Stage name} — {1-line description}
2. {Stage name} — {1-line description} [blocked by: 1]
3. {Stage name} — {1-line description} [blocked by: 2]
4. {Stage name} — {1-line description} [blocked by: 2]  <- parallel with 3
5. {Stage name} — {1-line description} [blocked by: 3, 4]

Parallel opportunities: {which stages can run concurrently}
```

After the worktree decision (see above), proceed to execution — do not wait for additional approval. The user invoked this skill intentionally.

---

## Phase 2: Execute

For each unblocked task (or group of simultaneously unblocked tasks):

### Worktree Setup

1. Create a worktree at `.claude/worktree/<task-slug>/`
2. If `.claude/worktree/` does not exist yet, create it and add it to `.gitignore`

### Dispatch Implementer

Spawn a fresh agent in the worktree following the agent-driven-development loop. The agent prompt includes:

- The full stage text from the plan
- **The design doc contents** (if located in Phase 0) — the plan describes execution order; the design doc describes *what to build and why*. Agents need both to make good implementation decisions.
- File scope (what to read, what to create/modify)
- Done criteria extracted from the plan
- Reference to TDD discipline (`skills/test-driven-development/SKILL.md`)
- Reference to self-verification (`skills/verification-before-completion/SKILL.md`)
- For bug-fix stages: reference to `skills/debug/root-cause-tracing.md` and `skills/debug/defense-in-depth.md`

The implementer reports one of: `DONE`, `DONE_WITH_CONCERNS`, `NEEDS_CONTEXT`, `BLOCKED`.

### Handle Status

Handle all statuses internally per the autonomous execution rules (see below). Never ask the user.

### Two-Stage Review

After the implementer finishes:

1. **Dispatch spec reviewer** — checks implementation matches the plan's intent for this stage. Uses the prompt template at `skills/agent-driven-development/spec-reviewer-prompt.md`.
2. If issues found: implementer fixes, spec reviewer re-reviews. Loop until clean.
3. **Dispatch code quality reviewer** — checks implementation is well-built. Uses the prompt template at `skills/agent-driven-development/code-quality-reviewer-prompt.md`.
4. If issues found: implementer fixes, quality reviewer re-reviews. Loop until clean.

Spec compliance must pass before code quality review begins.

### Merge

After both reviews pass:

1. Switch to the main working branch
2. Merge the worktree branch
3. If textual conflicts: resolve and run the full test suite
4. If tests fail after merge (semantic conflict): re-dispatch the task against the updated base
5. Clean up the worktree branch and directory

### Parallel Execution

Independent tasks (no dependency between them) run in parallel:

- Each gets its own worktree
- Each gets its own implementer agent
- Reviews can also run in parallel across different tasks
- Merges happen sequentially (first-done merges first; subsequent tasks rebase if needed)

### Task Completion

Mark each task complete in the native Task system. Dependents auto-unblock and become eligible for dispatch.

If an agent completed work belonging to a later stage (overlap detected via file diff), mark that later stage as done and skip dispatching it.

---

## Phase 3: Summary

Produce one final report after all tasks complete:

```markdown
## Plan Execution Complete

### Plan
{plan name/path}

### Stages Executed
| # | Stage | Status | Summary |
|---|-------|--------|---------|
| 1 | {name} | Done | {1-line} |
| 2 | {name} | Done | {1-line} |
| 3 | {name} | Parked | {reason} |

### Commits
{git log --oneline for all commits made during execution}

### Quality Notes
{Any DONE_WITH_CONCERNS observations, reviewer feedback worth noting}

### Concerns
{Parked tasks with reasons, blockers that could not be resolved, semantic conflicts encountered}
```

---

## Phase 4: Quality Gates

After presenting the summary report, offer quality checks via `AskUserQuestion`:

> "Implementation complete. Want to run quality checks?"

Options:
- **Both** (recommended) — run `/ralph-review` and `/spec-audit` in parallel
- **Ralph-review only** — autonomous review loop comparing implementation against specs
- **Spec-audit only** — audit spec coverage, find behavioral gaps
- **Done** — skip quality gates

These are token-heavy, so they are opt-in. But offering them at the natural completion point makes them easy to reach.

---

## Autonomous Execution

Once execution starts (phases 1-3), the controller never asks the user anything. Handle all statuses internally:

- **DONE** — proceed to spec review
- **DONE_WITH_CONCERNS** — read the concerns. If about correctness or scope, address before review. If observations ("this file is getting large"), note for the final report and proceed to review.
- **NEEDS_CONTEXT** — provide the missing context from the plan, specs, or codebase and re-dispatch
- **BLOCKED** — escalation ladder:
  1. Provide more context and re-dispatch
  2. Re-dispatch with a more capable model
  3. Break the task into smaller pieces
  4. Park the task and note it in the final report

One summary at the end. No mid-execution interruptions — except the quality gate offer after the summary (see Phase 4).

## Model Selection

Use the least powerful model that can handle each role:

| Signal | Model |
|--------|-------|
| Touches 1-2 files with complete spec | haiku |
| Touches multiple files with integration concerns | sonnet |
| Requires design judgment or broad codebase understanding | default (most capable) |
| Review roles (spec compliance, code quality) | default (most capable) |

---

## Token Conservation

The main thread's job is coordination only:

1. Never read source code files yourself — agents do that
2. Never write or edit code yourself — agents do that
3. Only read: plan files, agent results, git status/log/diff
4. Keep messages to agents detailed so they don't need follow-ups
5. Summarize, don't echo — when reporting results, summarize in 1-2 lines per stage

## Reference

Execution follows the agent-driven-development pattern. Read `skills/agent-driven-development/SKILL.md` for the full loop, and dispatch agents using the prompt templates in `skills/agent-driven-development/`.
