# Claude Code Workbench

A workbench for disciplined AI-assisted development. This isn't where you build applications — it's where you refine the system of *how* you build. Skills, rules, hooks, and the statusline are all parts of one system for making Claude Code repeatable and deliberate.

Steal what's useful, adapt to your workflow.

## Usage

Copy any `SKILL.md` file into your project's `.claude/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` or your global `~/.claude/skills/<name>/SKILL.md`.

## Claude Rules

Version-controlled CLAUDE.md snippets with a compilation system. Rules are the persistent behavioral instructions that tell Claude how you want it to work — the complement to skills, which define what it can do.

See [claude-rules/README.md](claude-rules/README.md) for setup and usage.

| Snippet | Scope | Description |
|---------|-------|-------------|
| `010-claudemd-management` | global | How CLAUDE.md files are compiled from snippets — never edit dist files directly |
| `020-plan-formatting` | global | Markdown formatting requirements for plans, reports, and structured output |
| `030-interaction-prefs` | global | Question-by-question and step-by-step interaction patterns |
| `040-plan-execution-handoff` | global | What to do after a plan is approved — archive, show execute command, offer options |
| `050-git-workflow` | global | Commit every turn, imperative messages, pre-commit hook for specs |
| `060-plannotator-spec-review` | global | Interactive spec review via Plannotator before committing |
| `070-testing` | global | Test-driven development defaults and framework choices by stack |
| `080-spec-driven-dev` | global | Spec-first development — spec then test then implement, never the reverse |
| `090-plan-archiving` | global | Archive approved plans to `specs/plans/` for future reference |
| `010-communication-style` | project | Be opinionated and decisive — recommend, don't hedge |
| `020-documentation` | project | Every app needs a README, setup docs, and inline comments |
| `030-working-directory` | project | Ephemeral scratch files go in `working/YYYY-MM-DD/` |
| `040-skill-naming` | project | Naming conventions — `airon-` and `thanx-` prefixes for private skills |

## Extras

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| [statusline.sh](bin/statusline.sh) | Custom Claude Code status line — context bar, git status, session topic, and terminal title |

The status line displays a **session topic** that Claude sets via the [set-topic](skills/set-topic/SKILL.md) skill. The statusline writes a PID-to-session mapping on each render; `/set-topic` writes the topic text to the same directory (`~/.claude/session-topics/`). Both pieces are needed for session topics to work.

To use the status line, point your Claude Code settings at it:
```json
{
  "statusLine": ".claude/bin/statusline.sh"
}
```

## Hooks

Shell scripts that run as [Claude Code hooks](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/hooks) to log skill usage for analysis.

| Hook | Trigger | Description |
|------|---------|-------------|
| [log-skill-use.sh](hooks/log-skill-use.sh) | `PostToolUse` (matcher: `Skill`) | Logs every Skill tool invocation to `~/.claude/skill-usage.tsv` |
| [log-slash-command.sh](hooks/log-slash-command.sh) | `UserPromptSubmit` | Logs user-typed `/commands` to the same TSV (deduplicates with the above) |

### Setup

1. Copy the hooks somewhere persistent (e.g., `~/.claude/hooks/`):
   ```bash
   mkdir -p ~/.claude/hooks
   cp hooks/log-skill-use.sh hooks/log-slash-command.sh ~/.claude/hooks/
   chmod +x ~/.claude/hooks/log-skill-use.sh ~/.claude/hooks/log-slash-command.sh
   ```

2. Register them in `~/.claude/settings.json`:
   ```json
   {
     "hooks": {
       "UserPromptSubmit": [
         {
           "hooks": [
             {
               "type": "command",
               "command": "~/.claude/hooks/log-slash-command.sh"
             }
           ]
         }
       ],
       "PostToolUse": [
         {
           "matcher": "Skill",
           "hooks": [
             {
               "type": "command",
               "command": "~/.claude/hooks/log-skill-use.sh"
             }
           ]
         }
       ]
     }
   }
   ```

3. Use the [skill-audit](skills/skill-audit/SKILL.md) skill to analyze the collected data after a few weeks.
