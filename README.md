# Claude Code Skills

Two things in one repo:

1. **Spec-driven development** — A complete workflow where specs are the source of truth, code implements specs, and a suite of skills keeps everything in sync. From idea to spec to plan to implementation to review.
2. **General-purpose skills** — Tools that make Claude Code smarter regardless of your workflow: session retrospectives, structured interviews, multi-agent debugging, PR automation, and more.

Steal what's useful. Most people point Claude at this repo and cherry-pick what fits their workflow.

## Quick start

### Option A: Install as a plugin (recommended)

```
/plugin install claude-skills@anutron/claude-skills
```

Then run the setup wizard:

```
/claude-skills:setup
```

Setup walks you through interactively — rules, hooks, statusline. Pick what you want, skip what you don't. Skills are available immediately as `/claude-skills:<name>`.

**Updates:** Plugin updates happen automatically. When rules, hooks, or the statusline change, a session-start check nudges you to re-run `/claude-skills:setup` to refresh the installed copies.

### Option B: Clone and promote (manual)

For more control, or if you want skills without the `claude-skills:` namespace prefix:

**1. Clone the repo:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/anutron/claude-skills.git ~/claude-skills
cd ~/claude-skills
```

**2. Install the rules** (compiles snippets into your `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`):

```bash
./claude-rules/compile.sh link     # set up CLAUDE.md targets
./claude-rules/compile.sh compile  # builds from snippets
```

If you already have a `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`, `link` asks how to handle it:
- **Replace** — backs up your file, symlinks to compiled output
- **Inject** — keeps your file, appends a managed section between begin/end markers that updates on recompile

See [claude-rules/README.md](claude-rules/README.md) for details.

**3. Promote skills globally** — open Claude Code in this repo and run:

```
/promote
```

This compares the skills in `skills/` against `~/.claude/skills/`, classifies each one, and symlinks the ones you choose. After promotion, skills are available in every project. Updates are a `git pull` away.

**4. (Optional, terminal only) Install hooks:**

```bash
# Session topic reminders
cp hooks/remind-session-topic.sh ~/.claude/hooks/
chmod +x ~/.claude/hooks/remind-session-topic.sh

# Skill usage logging
cp hooks/log-skill-use.sh ~/.claude/hooks/
chmod +x ~/.claude/hooks/log-skill-use.sh
```

Then register them in `~/.claude/settings.json` — see the [Session Topics](#session-topics) section for the hooks config format.

**5. (Optional, terminal only) Install the status line:**

```bash
cp bin/statusline.sh ~/.claude/
chmod +x ~/.claude/statusline.sh
```

Steps 1–3 work in the terminal CLI, VS Code, JetBrains, and the desktop app. Steps 4–5 are terminal-only — hooks and the status line rely on shell execution that IDE extensions don't support.

### Option C: Just steal what you like

Don't want the full toolkit? Grab `/steal` and use it to cherry-pick:

```
I want to use https://github.com/anutron/claude-skills/blob/main/skills/steal/SKILL.md — can you add this skill?
```

Then point it at this repo:

```
/steal https://github.com/anutron/claude-skills
```

This scans the repo and presents a report of what's worth stealing. You choose what to adopt — individual skills, patterns, or just ideas.

## Spec-Driven Development

The core idea: **specs describe what you're building before you build it.** If the spec and the code disagree, the code has a bug.

### Why specs?

Without specs, Claude builds what it thinks you mean. With specs, Claude builds what you agreed on. The spec is a behavioral contract — inputs, outputs, edge cases, error handling — written in plain language. It survives context window resets, session handoffs, and the "what did we decide?" problem.

Specs also make Claude dramatically better at reviews. When `/ralph-review` can compare code against a spec, it catches behavioral drift that no amount of code-only review would find.

### The workflow

```
idea → spec → plan → test → implement → review
```

Each step has a skill. The system enforces the order.

**1. Idea → Spec**

You describe what you want. Claude writes a spec using `/spec-writer`, which owns the format and ensures consistency. The spec captures behavior, not implementation — what the system does, not how.

For new features, use `/brainstorm` to explore the design space before committing to a spec. For smaller changes, just describe what you want and the spec gets updated inline.

**2. Spec → Plan**

The spec says *what*. The plan says *how* and *in what order*. Plans break specs into ordered implementation steps, each small enough to verify independently. A good plan makes implementation mechanical.

Plans are archived in `specs/plans/` so architectural decisions are preserved for future sessions.

**3. Plan → Test**

Tests encode the spec's behavioral expectations in executable form. Write them before implementation. They should all fail at this point.

**4. Test → Implement**

Write code to pass the tests. The spec constrains what to build. The tests validate whether it's correct. `/execute-plan` dispatches each plan stage to an agent.

**5. Implement → Review**

`/ralph-review` runs an autonomous review loop: compares the code against the spec, auto-fixes what it's confident about, parks questions for you. When it finds behavior the spec doesn't describe, it flags spec drift. When it finds spec requirements without tests, it writes the tests.

**6. Commit**

`/save-w-specs` commits code and specs together, verifying that behavioral changes include spec updates. It also runs lightweight safety checks (secrets detection, gitignore violations) before committing.

### Setting up spec-driven development

**1. Opt in.** Create a `.specs` file at your project root:

```
dir: specs
```

That's it. One line. The `dir` field says where specs live (defaults to `specs/`).

**2. Install the skills.** Copy these to `~/.claude/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` or `.claude/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` in your project. Or, if you clone this repo, use the [/promote](skills/promote/SKILL.md) skill to symlink skills from a git-tracked working directory to `~/.claude/skills/` — that way updates are a `git pull` away.

| Skill | What it does |
|-------|-------------|
| [spec-writer](skills/spec-writer/SKILL.md) | Write properly formatted spec text — single source of truth for the SPEC format |
| [spec-recommender](skills/spec-recommender/SKILL.md) | Detect code without spec coverage, infer intent, present options |
| [spec-audit](skills/spec-audit/SKILL.md) | Audit codebase spec coverage — inventory files and specs, map them, find behavioral gaps |
| [spec-todo](skills/spec-todo/SKILL.md) | List and execute deferred work items from `specs/todo/` |
| [ralph-review](skills/ralph-review/SKILL.md) | Autonomous review loop — compares code against specs, auto-fixes, flags drift |
| [save-w-specs](skills/save-w-specs/SKILL.md) | Spec-aware commits — verifies specs updated alongside behavioral changes |
| [plannotator-specs](skills/plannotator-specs/SKILL.md) | Interactive spec review with inline annotations (requires [Plannotator](https://github.com/anutron/plannotator)) |

**3. Install the rules.** Copy the relevant rule snippets to your project's CLAUDE.md (or use the [snippet compilation system](claude-rules/README.md)):

| Rule | What it does |
|------|-------------|
| [080-spec-driven-dev](claude-rules/snippets/global/080-spec-driven-dev.md) | Enforces spec-first order: spec → test → implement |
| [090-plan-archiving](claude-rules/snippets/global/090-plan-archiving.md) | Archives approved plans to `specs/plans/` |
| [040-plan-execution-handoff](claude-rules/snippets/global/040-plan-execution-handoff.md) | What to do after plan approval — archive, execute, or hand off |
| [070-testing](claude-rules/snippets/global/070-testing.md) | Test-driven development defaults |

**4. (Optional) Install the pre-commit hook.** Blocks commits when behavioral code changes don't include a spec update:

```bash
cp scripts/spec-check-hook.sh .git/hooks/pre-commit
chmod +x .git/hooks/pre-commit
```

### Graceful degradation

Every skill checks for `.specs` at startup. Without it, they still work — they just skip spec-related behavior:

- `/ralph-review` without specs → reviews against plans or conservative mode (bugs/security only)
- `/save-w-specs` without specs → normal commit, no spec verification
- `/execute-plan` without specs → executes the plan, no spec cross-referencing

You can adopt individual skills without buying into the full spec system.

### Retrofitting specs onto existing code

If you have a codebase without specs, use `/spec-recommender` to scan for unspecified behavior and infer intent. It presents options — you approve, then `/spec-writer` produces the spec text. It's working backwards (you lose the original intent), but it gives you a starting point.

This works well for small-to-medium codebases. For large-scale applications, you'll likely need an additional harness to run `/spec-recommender` across modules systematically — the skill is designed for focused, per-file analysis, not whole-repo sweeps.

## Session Topics

The [set-topic](skills/set-topic/SKILL.md) skill lets Claude (or you) set a session topic that displays in the [status line](bin/statusline.sh). The [remind-session-topic](hooks/remind-session-topic.sh) hook ensures Claude actually does it -- it fires after every response and reminds Claude to set the topic if one isn't set yet, escalating after 5 turns.

### How it works

- Claude sets the topic via `/set-topic --initial <topic>` when it has enough context. The `--initial` flag no-ops if a topic is already set, so Claude can't overwrite it.
- The `Stop` hook checks after each response whether a topic exists. If not, it injects a reminder. After 5 turns it gets firm.
- You can override the topic anytime with `/set-topic <text>` (no `--initial` flag).

### Setup

**1. Install the hook:**

```bash
cp hooks/remind-session-topic.sh ~/.claude/hooks/
chmod +x ~/.claude/hooks/remind-session-topic.sh
```

**2. Register the hook** in `~/.claude/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "Stop": [
      {
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "~/.claude/hooks/remind-session-topic.sh"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

**3. Add the rule** to your CLAUDE.md (or use the [snippet](claude-rules/snippets/global/055-session-topics.md)):

```markdown
## Session Topics

When you have enough context to understand what the session is about, set the topic
by invoking `/set-topic --initial <topic>`. Do this silently -- don't announce it.

- Keep it concise (under ~50 chars). It renders in ALL CAPS.
- `--initial` no-ops if a topic is already set, so you cannot accidentally overwrite it.
- Do not invoke `/set-topic` more than once. Only the user can change the topic after it's set.
- If the system reminds you to set a topic, do it on your next response.
```

**4. (Optional) Install the [statusline](bin/statusline.sh)** to actually display the topic.

### Validation

The `/set-topic` skill checks for the hook on every invocation. If the hook is missing, it prints a warning with a link to setup instructions. This surfaces the misconfiguration the first time Claude tries to set a topic.
