# Setup

Interactive onboarding for the claude-skills toolkit. Walks the user through what to install and configures everything.

## Context

- Plugin root: !`echo "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT:-$(cd "$(dirname "$0")/../.." && pwd)}"`
- Rules installed: !`grep -qF 'claude-rules managed section' ~/.claude/CLAUDE.md 2>/dev/null && echo "inject mode" || ([ -L ~/.claude/CLAUDE.md ] && readlink ~/.claude/CLAUDE.md | grep -q claude-rules && echo "symlink mode" || echo "no")`
- Statusline installed: !`[ -f ~/.claude/statusline.sh ] && echo "yes" || echo "no"`
- Hooks installed: !`[ -f ~/.claude/hooks/remind-session-topic.sh ] && echo "yes" || echo "no"`
- Current settings hooks: !`cat ~/.claude/settings.json 2>/dev/null | grep -c '"command"' || echo "0"` hook(s) configured

## Instructions

You are running the setup wizard for the claude-skills toolkit. Be friendly and concise. Ask questions one at a time.

### Step 1: Detect the plugin root

The plugin root is where the claude-skills repo lives. Check the context above for `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}`. If empty, try to find it:

```bash
# Check common locations
for dir in "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT:-}" "$(pwd)" "$HOME/claude-skills" "$HOME/anutron-claude-skills"; do
  [ -f "$dir/.claude-plugin/plugin.json" ] && echo "$dir" && break
done
```

Store this path — all subsequent steps reference files relative to it. If not found, ask the user where they cloned the repo.

### Step 2: Rules

Check if rules are already installed (see context). If already installed, say so and skip to step 3.

If not installed, ask:

> The toolkit includes behavioral rules for Claude — git workflow, testing, spec-driven development, markdown formatting, and more. These go in your `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`.
>
> Would you like to install them?

If yes, explain the two modes and ask which they prefer:

> **Replace** — your current `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` gets backed up and replaced entirely with the toolkit rules. Best if you're starting fresh.
>
> **Inject** — keeps your existing rules intact and appends a managed section with begin/end markers. On future updates, only the managed section changes. Best if you already have custom rules.

Then execute the chosen mode:

**Replace mode:**
```bash
PLUGIN_ROOT="<detected root>"
DIST="$PLUGIN_ROOT/claude-rules/dist"
mkdir -p "$DIST"
# Compile
cd "$PLUGIN_ROOT/claude-rules" && bash compile.sh compile
# Back up and symlink
[ -f ~/.claude/CLAUDE.md ] && cp ~/.claude/CLAUDE.md ~/.claude/CLAUDE.md.bak.$(date +%Y%m%d)
ln -sf "$DIST/global.md" ~/.claude/CLAUDE.md
echo "symlink" > "$DIST/.mode-global"
shasum -a 256 "$DIST/global.md" | awk '{print $1}' > "$DIST/.installed-hash"
```

**Inject mode:**
```bash
PLUGIN_ROOT="<detected root>"
cd "$PLUGIN_ROOT/claude-rules" && bash compile.sh compile
# The inject function from compile.sh
MARKER_BEGIN="<!-- BEGIN claude-rules managed section — do not edit between these markers -->"
MARKER_END="<!-- END claude-rules managed section -->"
DIST="$PLUGIN_ROOT/claude-rules/dist"
if grep -qF "$MARKER_BEGIN" ~/.claude/CLAUDE.md 2>/dev/null; then
  # Update existing section
  tmp=$(mktemp)
  awk -v begin="$MARKER_BEGIN" -v end="$MARKER_END" -v cfile="$DIST/global.md" '
    $0 == begin { print; while ((getline line < cfile) > 0) print line; skip=1; next }
    skip && $0 == end { print; skip=0; next }
    !skip { print }
  ' ~/.claude/CLAUDE.md > "$tmp"
  mv "$tmp" ~/.claude/CLAUDE.md
else
  printf '\n%s\n' "$MARKER_BEGIN" >> ~/.claude/CLAUDE.md
  cat "$DIST/global.md" >> ~/.claude/CLAUDE.md
  printf '%s\n' "$MARKER_END" >> ~/.claude/CLAUDE.md
fi
echo "inject" > "$DIST/.mode-global"
# Stamp installed hash for version checking
shasum -a 256 "$DIST/global.md" | awk '{print $1}' > "$DIST/.installed-hash"
```

After either mode, always stamp the installed hash so version-check.sh can detect when an update is available:
```bash
DIST="$PLUGIN_ROOT/claude-rules/dist"
shasum -a 256 "$DIST/global.md" | awk '{print $1}' > "$DIST/.installed-hash"
```

### Step 3: Terminal features

Ask:

> Are you using Claude Code in the **terminal** (not VS Code, JetBrains, or the desktop app)?
> Terminal-only features: status line and session topic hooks.

If no (or they're unsure), skip to the summary — these features only work in the terminal CLI.

If yes, ask about each feature:

#### Statusline

> The **status line** shows context usage, git status, and session topic at the top of every response. Install it?

If yes:
```bash
PLUGIN_ROOT="<detected root>"
cp "$PLUGIN_ROOT/bin/statusline.sh" ~/.claude/statusline.sh
chmod +x ~/.claude/statusline.sh
```

#### Hooks

> **Hooks** add two behaviors:
> - Session topic reminders — nudges Claude to set a topic for each session
> - Skill usage logging — logs which skills you use to `~/.claude/skill-usage.tsv`
>
> Install hooks?

If yes:
```bash
PLUGIN_ROOT="<detected root>"
mkdir -p ~/.claude/hooks
cp "$PLUGIN_ROOT/hooks/remind-session-topic.sh" ~/.claude/hooks/
cp "$PLUGIN_ROOT/hooks/log-skill-use.sh" ~/.claude/hooks/
cp "$PLUGIN_ROOT/hooks/log-slash-command.sh" ~/.claude/hooks/
chmod +x ~/.claude/hooks/*.sh
```

Then update `~/.claude/settings.json` to register the hooks. Read the current file, merge the hooks config, and write it back. The hooks config to add:

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "Stop": [
      {
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "~/.claude/hooks/remind-session-topic.sh"
          }
        ]
      }
    ],
    "PreToolUse": [
      {
        "matcher": "Skill",
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "~/.claude/hooks/log-skill-use.sh"
          }
        ]
      }
    ],
    "UserPromptSubmit": [
      {
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "~/.claude/hooks/log-slash-command.sh"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

Be careful to merge, not overwrite — the user may have existing hooks. Read `~/.claude/settings.json`, add any missing hook entries, write it back.

### Step 4: Summary

Print a clear summary of what was installed:

```
Setup complete!

  Rules:      installed (inject mode)
  Statusline: installed
  Hooks:      installed (3 hooks)

To update later: git pull in the plugin directory, then run /claude-skills:setup again.
Available skills: /claude-skills:list-skills
```

Adjust the summary based on what was actually installed vs skipped.
